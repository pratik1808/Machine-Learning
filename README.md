# Machine Learning

This repository contains projects working on real life data performing Analytics and prediction using Python and R. It also contains analysis performed to explore key concepts in Machine Learning and presents insights about the same. Some of the key concepts are as follows; Regression with Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net regularization, Bias Variance TradeOff; Learning Curves; Stochastic Gradient Descent and Momentum, Tensorflow Playground, t-SNE & PCA Dimensionality Reduction, PyOD Outlier Detection (KNN, INNE), Preprocessing and Sampling, Expected Loss for Classficiation, Logistic Regression expression and formulation, Classfication with Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, MLP and imbalanced classes handling using SMOTE, Comparison of ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall Curves, Bayesian Belief Networks, SVM.
